   <html>
   <head>
   <title>My webpage</title>

   <!--header-->

   <!--start-->

   <H1>Welcome</H1>
   <P>Here's some content for my webpage.</P>

   <!--footer-->



DESCRIPTION

   Straight from the Eagle book, with a couple minor additions.
   Looks for  <!--header--> <!--start--> <!--footer-->
   in your html code.  The idea is to put as much into the config files,
   leaving only content for each html page.  This makes it very simple for
   users to update content without digging through javascript, tables & navigation
   code. A sample nav.conf, header, and footer is included in the distribution.
   Taylor these to your website.

   This can also be acheived through server side includes, but you won't     
   have the nice highlight effect.

   A working demo is at http://www.s1te.com
